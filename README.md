# Algorithms exercises

Keep cal, i'm just a noob! ðŸ˜‰\
This project was developed with the aim of practicing different types of algorithms with different languages. Most of the solutions implemented here do not need to be applied in production environments, as most languages â€‹â€‹already have native resources applying the techniques and algorithms present in this project, but if anything here helps you... Bon appÃ©tit!
